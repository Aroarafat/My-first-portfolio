            <P>Among all the creatures on Earth, human being is definitely superior. Writing a few lines or words about
                myself to introduce, I feel myself to be tiny part of this entire world that is filled with the human
                beings
                around. I am a human. I myself am humble, kind, caring and courageous. I am most respected, loved and
                responsible human being. Though, it is quite hard to write about yourself yet I have tried myself best
                to
                express all about myself.I am from a working class family, I am Mohammad Aarafat Hossain. I am simple,
                sweet, confident and cunning fellow. My father is a BUSINESSMAN who knows how to love his profession
                with
                passion and dedication. While my mother is a HOUSEWIFE.</P>

                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
